# Claude Code Projects Index

A curated collection of Claude Code projects, agent workspace blueprints, and related resources — organized by use case. Most patterns here adapt to other agentic AI CLIs and frameworks.

**[Browse online](https://claude.danielrosehill.com)** · **[Plugins Marketplace](https://github.com/danielrosehill/Claude-Code-Plugins)** · **[Documentation portal](https://docs.bydanielrosehill.com)** · **[What are Claude Spaces?](./claude-spaces.md)**

> 🧩 **My Claude Code Plugins Marketplace** — [danielrosehill/Claude-Code-Plugins](https://github.com/danielrosehill/Claude-Code-Plugins) — 28 focused **cluster plugins** covering workflows across sysadmin, research, media, writing, planning, and more. Each plugin ships the domain primitives (commands, skills, agents) globally and provisions per-project scaffolds on demand — so you install the plugin once and scaffold new workspaces from it as needed, rather than cloning a separate template repo per workflow.

## About This Index

I've been using Claude Code daily for about six months — for development, but also audio editing, legal research, SEO analysis, health documentation, systems administration, and a long tail of non-code use cases. This index is the result: a collection of **agent workspaces** (repositories structured as self-contained environments for a specific activity) alongside supporting tooling — plugins, context files, MCP servers, and slash commands.

If there's a common thread, it's treating Claude Code less as a coding assistant and more as a general-purpose agent workspace that happens to run in a terminal.

| Type | What it is | Badge |
|------|------------|-------|
| **Agent Workspace** | Pre-configured repo using Claude as a conversational UI for a domain-specific workflow | ![Agent Workspace](https://img.shields.io/badge/Agent-Workspace-purple?style=flat-square) |
| **Template** | Forkable starting point you can customize | ![Template](https://img.shields.io/badge/Template-Ready-green?style=flat-square) |
| **Non-Code** | Applications beyond software development | ![Non-Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Non--Code-teal?style=flat-square) |

![Agent Workspace Definition](images/claude-space.png)

<details>
<summary><strong>More context: the Agent Workspace Model, growth chart, praise</strong></summary>

#### The Agent Workspace Pattern

All workspaces in this index follow the same pattern: a Git repository isn't just for code — it can serve as a complete, self-contained workspace for *any* activity. Each workspace uses a defined folder structure, a `CLAUDE.md` for agent instructions, slash commands, MCP configurations, and subagent definitions to create a purpose-built environment.

This pattern has been applied to everything from sysadmin and remote server management to legal research, health documentation, and financial planning — domains that have nothing to do with software development.

**Primitives globally, scaffolds per-cluster.** The tooling has been consolidated into **28 cluster plugins** (see [Plugins](#plugins)) — each one ships the domain primitives globally (commands, skills, agents for that cluster) and provisions a project scaffold on demand. So rather than forking a separate template repo for each new workflow, you install the relevant cluster plugin once and ask Claude Code to provision a scaffold wherever you need one.

#### Repository Growth

![Repository Count Over Time](charts/repo-count-chart.png)

#### Praise

> *"This is either the work of a prolific genius, or a very clever bot (or both), although it hardly matters because the quality is so good - an index of 75+ Claude Code repositories published by the author... CMS, system design, deep research, IoT, agentic workflows, server management, personal health... If you spot the lie, let me know, otherwise please check these out."*

For the record: I'm a real human ([danielrosehill.com](https://danielrosehill.com)). The repos and workspaces in this index are generated with Claude Code but human-designed and refined.

# Templates / Scaffolds

Scaffolds used to be distributed as ~100 standalone template repos and a `New-Repo-From-Template` plugin. That pattern was retired in the April 2026 reshape.

**Scaffolds now live inside the [cluster plugins](#plugins).** Each of the 28 cluster plugins bundles the workspace primitives for its domain (commands, skills, agents, MCP configs) and exposes a provisioning skill that writes a fresh per-project scaffold on demand — so instead of cloning a template repo, you install the relevant plugin once and ask Claude Code to scaffold a new workspace for whatever project you're starting.

See the [Plugins](#plugins) section above for the full cluster list.
