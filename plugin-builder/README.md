# Plugin Builder

Interactive plugin builder for Claude Code - serves as both an example plugin and a tool to create new plugins through guided prompts.

## Overview

The Plugin Builder helps you create high-quality Claude Code plugins through an interactive, question-based workflow. It handles all the scaffolding and ensures your plugins follow best practices.

## Features

- **Modular builder architecture** - Specialized builder skills for each component type (commands, agents, hooks, skills, MCP servers)
- **Guided plugin creation** - Interactive prompts walk you through creating any type of component
- **Multi-component support** - Create commands, agents, hooks, skills, and MCP servers in one session
- **Best practices built-in** - Each builder skill follows industry best practices and context engineering principles
- **Natural language editing** - Edit existing components by describing changes in plain English
- **Example reference** - The plugin itself demonstrates proper plugin structure
- **Validation tools** - Check your plugins for common issues before publishing

## Installation

```bash
/plugin install ./plugin-builder
```

Or if adding from the Claude Market marketplace:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add claude-market/marketplace
/plugin install plugin-builder
```

## Commands

### `/plugin-builder:init`

Initialize a new plugin with guided prompts.

**Workflow:**

1. Asks for your GitHub username (for CODEOWNERS)
2. Collects plugin metadata (name, description, license)
3. Creates top-level plugin directory (`./{plugin-name}/`)
4. Asks what components you want to create (commands, agents, hooks, skills, MCP servers)
5. For each component, asks detailed questions to understand requirements
6. Generates all files with comprehensive, well-structured prompts
7. Creates plugin manifest, CODEOWNERS, and README
8. Shows summary and installation instructions

**Example usage:**

```
/plugin-builder:init
```

### `/plugin-builder:add`

Add a new component to an existing plugin using specialized builder skills.

**Use this when:**

- You already have a plugin and want to add another command, agent, hook, skill, or MCP server
- You want to expand your plugin's functionality

**Workflow:**

1. Select which plugin to add to
2. Choose component type to add (Command, Agent, Hook, Skill, or MCP Server)
3. Provide basic information (name and brief description)
4. Appropriate builder skill is invoked to guide you through detailed creation:
   - **Commands**: `cc-command-builder` handles slash command creation
   - **Agents**: `cc-agent-builder` handles subagent creation
   - **Hooks**: `cc-hook-builder` handles hook configuration
   - **Skills**: `cc-skill-builder` handles skill creation
   - **MCP Servers**: `cc-mcp-builder` handles MCP server configuration
5. Builder skill generates the component following best practices
6. Updates plugin.json and README automatically

**Example usage:**

```
/plugin-builder:add
```

### `/plugin-builder:edit`

Use natural language to make edits to your existing plugin components with specialized builder skill assistance.

**Use this when:**

- You want to modify an existing command, agent, hook, skill, or MCP server
- You need to update functionality, fix issues, or refactor a component
- You want to make changes using conversational descriptions instead of manual file editing

**Workflow:**

1. Select which plugin to edit
2. Choose which component to modify
3. Describe your desired changes in natural language
4. Appropriate builder skill is invoked with context about the existing component:
   - **Commands**: `cc-command-builder` helps apply changes
   - **Agents**: `cc-agent-builder` helps apply changes
   - **Hooks**: `cc-hook-builder` helps apply changes
   - **Skills**: `cc-skill-builder` helps apply changes
   - **MCP Servers**: `cc-mcp-builder` helps apply changes
5. Builder skill interprets your intent and applies edits following best practices
6. Review the changes and confirm
7. Optionally update README and version number

**Example natural language edits:**

- "Add validation for email addresses"
- "Make it ask for confirmation before deleting"
- "Change the default model from haiku to sonnet"
- "Add better error handling"
- "Include usage examples in the documentation"
- "Make it work with TypeScript files too"

**Example usage:**

```
/plugin-builder:edit
```

### `/plugin-builder:validate`

Validate plugin structure and configuration.

**Checks:**

- Required files exist (plugin.json, component files)
- Directory structure is correct
- JSON files are valid
- Plugin manifest has required fields
- Component files match what's listed in plugin.json
- Names follow kebab-case convention
- No duplicate component names
- README exists and contains key information

**Provides:**

- ✓ List of passed checks
- ✗ List of failed checks with fixes
- ⚠ Warnings and recommendations
- Actionable next steps

**Example usage:**

```
/plugin-builder:validate
```

### `/plugin-builder:publish`

Publish your plugin changes to the Claude Market marketplace with automated validation, manifest generation, and pull request creation.

**Use this when:**

- You've made changes to a plugin and want to submit them to the marketplace
- You want to add a new plugin to the Claude Market
- You need an automated workflow from validation to PR creation

**Workflow:**

1. **Detect changes**: Runs `git diff main` to identify which plugins have been modified
2. **Validate in parallel**: Runs `/plugin-builder:validate` for each changed plugin simultaneously
3. **Generate manifest**: Runs `make generate-marketplace-json` to update `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
4. **Create semantic commit**: Generates a commit message following conventional commits format
5. **Branch management**: Creates a new branch (if on main) in format `{user}/{plugin}/{description}`
6. **Create PR**: Uses GitHub CLI to create a pull request with pre-filled template

**Requirements:**

- Changes must be committed to a git branch
- All changed plugins must pass validation
- `make` must be available (for marketplace.json generation)
- `gh` CLI is recommended but optional (for automated PR creation)

**Example usage:**

```
/plugin-builder:publish
```

**What it does:**

- Validates all changed plugins in parallel
- Stops if any validation fails
- Generates semantic commit message like `feat(plugin-name): added new command`
- Creates branch like `danielkov/plugin-name/add-new-command`
- Opens PR with filled-in template including plugin metadata, components, and testing checklist

**Without GitHub CLI:**

If `gh` CLI is not installed, the command will provide a manual PR link and suggest installing GitHub CLI for future use.

### How Builder Skills Work

Builder skills follow the [Anthropic Context Engineering Guide](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents) principles:

1. **Progressive Disclosure** - Information revealed incrementally as needed
2. **Minimal Context** - Only essential details in frontmatter, detailed guidance on invocation
3. **Tool Efficiency** - Curated minimal tool sets for each builder
4. **Structured Guidance** - Clear step-by-step workflows
5. **Best Practices** - Industry-standard patterns and anti-patterns

When you use `/plugin-builder:add` or `/plugin-builder:edit`, the appropriate builder skill is automatically invoked to guide you through creation or modification with expert knowledge specific to that component type.

## Component Types

### Slash Commands

Custom shortcuts invoked as `/plugin-name:command-name`. Use for frequently-used operations, scaffolding, or complex workflows.

### Agents (Subagents)

Specialized agents for specific development tasks. They can have restricted tool access and custom prompts optimized for their purpose.

### Hooks

Behavior customizations that run at key workflow points (before user input, before/after tool calls, agent start/end).

### Skills

Domain-specific expertise that can be invoked when needed. Skills provide specialized knowledge without always being active.

### MCP Servers

Integration with Model Context Protocol servers to add external tools and data sources.

2. **Include examples** - Show expected behavior and usage patterns
3. **Handle edge cases** - Think about what could go wrong and address it
4. **Use proper naming** - Always use kebab-case for component names
5. **Provide clear descriptions** - Help users understand what each component does
6. **Add keywords** - Improve discoverability in marketplaces
7. **Test before publishing** - Use `/plugin-builder:validate` to check for issues
