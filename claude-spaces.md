# Agent Workspaces & The Claude Spaces Pattern

Many of the repositories in this index are **agent workspaces** — structured repository environments designed for agentic AI workflows. The pattern I originally called "Claude Spaces" describes my specific method for creating these workspaces using repository structure, context files, and Claude Code's built-in features.

**The pattern is now packaged as [cluster plugins](https://github.com/danielrosehill/Claude-Code-Plugins)** — each plugin ships the folder structure, CLAUDE.md template, slash commands, subagents, and MCP configs for a specific domain (sysadmin, legal research, health documentation, financial planning, and more) and provisions a per-project scaffold on demand. To spin up your own workspace, install the relevant cluster plugin and ask Claude Code to scaffold one where you need it.

The repositories marked with the ![Agent Workspace](https://img.shields.io/badge/Agent-Workspace-purple?style=flat-square) badge in the main index are examples of this pattern in action.

# The "Claude Space" Method

*Dictated: 11-Jan-2025*

Very few who are deeply involved in the agentic AI of early 2026 would disagree that agentic AI is quite complicated, although immensely powerful.

Over the past few months, I have developed a pattern of using the structure of a repository to create an organized agent workspace for a specific project — sometimes a time-limited one, and at other times an ongoing project.

Many of these are private, although some are public. I have developed my own workflow for structuring these, relying upon the simple structure of a repository to provide approximate boundaries for agents and humans to work. At its most basic, this can be a top-level folder for inputs and outputs. More elaborate structures can be easily developed based on this model.

I use the GitHub template structure because it allows me to quickly spend time (sometimes significant time and effort) developing the idea for a particular application and determining how it could work. I can then iterate upon it in the future, or simply define the template once without any intention of iterating, but use it repeatedly as suitable projects arise.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

There are definite disadvantages to the repository-centric model for experimenting with agentic AI workflows.

For one, it is confined to the user's computer. Sometimes I view the repository model as a fitting one for a project, even if it comes at the cost of some portability. In other instances, I view these as precursors to more flexible agentic frameworks. But either way, this mechanism provides a superlatively useful way to experiment with the capabilities of agentic AI.

I have come to realize why the model resonates with me (and perhaps others doing similar things) so much: it views the repository as a miniaturized version of what can be achieved with otherwise very complicated systems.

In the context of AI, Anthropic has perfected the art in Claude of using Markdown files as a simple mechanism for defining unique things like plugins and skills. While some view this as exaggerated, I think it makes a lot of sense. Whether you are a proficient coder or not, learning Markdown is easy, and it enables one to quickly define and achieve real results with AI.

My mechanism for using transcription extensively to capture contextual information and save it in the repository provides an almost lightweight version of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). I have experimented with more formal vectorization strategies, as well as actually using RAG, but I think that simply referring the agent to Markdown files provides a lightweight way to achieve this at the prototype level.

## Broad Applications

The pattern has taken on a definite contour and has remained relatively stable since I started using it, such that improvements are currently mostly incremental changes that are rolled out in concert with Claude.

I see no meaningful difference in whether this approach is used in the context of systems administration, code generation, or a non-coding project entirely. I feel particularly passionate about the idea that this approach — the simple mechanism of a repository and the fantastic version control afforded by Git — provides an instructive model in workflow management that has applications far beyond software development.

As a technical writer, I feel that this is also particularly suitable for authorship. With MCP, the foundation of an agent workspace can be used to manage external systems, whether those be inventory tools, CRM systems, or even creating bespoke analysis based upon a connection with a web analytics dashboard.
